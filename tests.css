/*

Write a function: function smallestInt(A);

that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

Example: given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.

Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].

Write test cases to validate that your implementation conforms to the specification.

Additionally, implement the benchmark function to test the performance of your solution. The benchmark should be able to run 
in the browser and be capable of outputting a reasonably reliable score when comparing solutions in the same environment.

You will be evaluated based on:
- Correctness according to instructions
- Efficiency
- Code style and quality

You're advised to include any less efficient solutions or pseudo code definitions of such solutions in your final submission.
